Scenario: Gherkin
Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation to define structure. 
Line endings terminate statements (e.g. steps). Most lines start with a keyword.

Scenario: Cucumber
Cucumber understands the language Gherkin. It reads Gherkin and then triggers code 
in Ruby, but there are Java and Javascript versions as well.

Scenario: SpecFlow
Cucumber for C#
